Couple of features implemented as an improvement:

BDD approach is followed : Required Feature file is written with scenarios and respective step definition files are
created using page object model.

Report - I have used cucumber reports to track test run results.(Please refer 'overview-features.html' for results in
graphical & tabular form

Logging - I have tried to use logging which helps us keep a track of every action performed during test run, which in turn
helps us to debug test failures and find root cause
